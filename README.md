<b>Abstract</b>
Job applicants may benefit when interviewers provide questions prior to an employment interview. For
example, knowing the questions gives applicants more time to determine what is assessed. However,
having access to the questions may also allow applicants to engage in more impression management
(IM) tactics. Applicants might draw honestly from relevant experiences (honest IM), but they might also
embellish, or outright fake (deceptive IM), experiences to align with what they think is assessed in these
provided questions. The present study examines whether providing questions before the selection
interview affects the use of IM tactics. We recruited applicants (_n_ = 133) following a real, high-stakes
selection interview for a research assistant position. Applicants were randomly assigned to conditions
where questions were either provided five minutes prior to the interview or not. Using independent
groups t-tests, no significant differences between conditions were found for applicants’ use of honest IM
(_M<sub>diff</sub>_ = 0.09 , 95% CI[-0.25, 0.08] , Cohen’s _d_ = 0.18, 95% CI[-0.16, 0.52]), or deceptive IM (_M<sub>diff</sub>_ = 0.09 ,
95% CI[-0.29, 0.11], Cohen’s _d_ = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.18, 0.50]). Based on the results, it appears that
providing applicants with the questions for five minutes before the interview does not significantly
impact how they honestly manage impressions or fake in the interview.
